To feed a live video to your CNN model through an API, you'll need to:

**Step 1: API Design**

* Design a RESTful API that accepts video streams as input.
* Define API endpoints for sending video streams and receiving object detection results.
* Use a programming language like Python, Java, or Node.js to implement the API.

**Step 2: Video Stream Processing**

* Use a library like OpenCV or FFmpeg to capture and process the video stream.
* Convert the raw video stream into a format suitable for processing (e.g., frames, images).
* Resize the frames to a fixed size (e.g., 224x224) to match the input size of your CNN model.
* Normalize the pixel values to a range suitable for the chosen activation function (e.g., [0, 1] or [-1, 1]).

**Step 3: API Endpoint**

* Create an API endpoint that accepts video streams as input.
* Use a library like Flask or Django to create a RESTful API in Python.
* Define a POST request endpoint that accepts video streams as multipart/form-data.

**Step 4: Model Inference**

* Use the received video stream to make predictions using your trained CNN model.
* Use a library like TensorFlow or PyTorch to load your trained model and make predictions on the input frames.
* Apply non-maximum suppression (NMS) to remove duplicate detections and reduce the number of bounding boxes.
* Use the class probabilities to determine the object class and confidence score for each detection.

**Step 5: API Response**

* Return the detected objects and snapshots as a JSON response.
* Use a library like JSONEncoder to convert the object detection results into a JSON format.

**Step 6: Client-Side Integration**

* Use a client-side library like JavaScript or HTML5 to integrate the API with a web application.
* Use the API endpoint to send video streams and receive object detection results.

Here's some sample Python code using Flask and TensorFlow to create an API endpoint:
```python
from flask import Flask, request, jsonify
import tensorflow as tf

app = Flask(__name__)

# Load the trained model
model = tf.keras.models.load_model('object_detection_model.h5')

@app.route('/object_detection', methods=['POST'])
def object_detection():
    # Get the video stream from the request
    video_stream = request.files['video_stream']
    
    # Process the video stream
    frames = []
    for frame in video_stream:
        # Resize the frame to the input size of the model
        frame = cv2.resize(frame, (224, 224))
        
        # Normalize the pixel values
        frame = frame / 255.0
        
        # Make predictions on the input frame
        predictions = model.predict(frame[None, ...])
        
        # Detect objects and generate snapshots
        detections = []
        for detection in predictions:
            # Apply non-maximum suppression
            detection = tf.image.non_max_suppression(detection, 0.5)
            
            # Visualize the detected objects
            cv2.rectangle(frame, (detection[1], detection[2]), (detection[3], detection[4]), (0, 255, 0), 2)
            
            # Output the detected objects and snapshots
            print(f"Object detected: {detection[0]} with confidence {detection[5]}")
        
        # Add the processed frame to the list
        frames.append(frame)
    
    # Return the detected objects and snapshots as a JSON response
    return jsonify({'detections': [detection.tolist() for detection in detections]})

if __name__ == '__main__':
    app.run(debug=True)
```
This code creates a Flask API endpoint that accepts video streams as input, processes the video stream, makes predictions using the trained CNN model, and returns the detected objects and snapshots as a JSON response.
