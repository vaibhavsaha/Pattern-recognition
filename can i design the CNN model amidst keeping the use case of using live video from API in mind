**1. Model Architecture:**

* Design the CNN model to be lightweight and efficient, as it will be processing live video streams.
* Use a smaller model architecture, such as MobileNet or ShuffleNet, which are designed for mobile and embedded devices.
* Consider using a transfer learning approach, where you pre-train the model on a large dataset and fine-tune it on your specific use case.

**2. Input Size:**

* Design the model to accept input frames of a fixed size, such as 224x224 or 320x240.
* Use a library like OpenCV to resize the input frames to the desired size.
* Consider using a data augmentation technique, such as random cropping or flipping, to increase the diversity of the training data.

**3. Batch Size:**

* Design the model to process batches of input frames, rather than individual frames.
* Use a batch size of 1 or 2, depending on the computational resources available.
* Consider using a GPU-accelerated library like TensorFlow or PyTorch to speed up the model inference process.

**4. Inference Speed:**

* Design the model to make predictions at a high frame rate, such as 30 FPS or higher.
* Use a library like OpenCV to capture and process the video stream.
* Consider using a GPU-accelerated library like TensorFlow or PyTorch to speed up the model inference process.

**5. Output Format:**

* Design the model to output the detected objects and snapshots in a format suitable for the API.
* Use a library like JSONEncoder to convert the object detection results into a JSON format.
* Consider using a messaging queue like RabbitMQ or Apache Kafka to handle the API requests and responses.

Here's an example of how you can design a CNN model amidst keeping the use case of using live video from API in mind:
```python
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow.keras.applications import MobileNet
from tensorflow.keras.layers import Conv2D, MaxPooling2D, Flatten, Dense

# Load the MobileNet model
base_model = MobileNet(weights='imagenet', include_top=False, input_shape=(224, 224, 3))

# Freeze the base model layers
for layer in base_model.layers:
    layer.trainable = False

# Add a new classification head
x = Conv2D(128, (3, 3), activation='relu')(base_model.output)
x = MaxPooling2D((2, 2))(x)
x = Flatten()(x)
x = Dense(1024, activation='relu')(x)
x = Dense(8, activation='softmax')(x)

# Compile the model
model = tf.keras.Model(inputs=base_model.input, outputs=x)
model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='categorical_crossentropy', metrics=['accuracy'])

# Train the model on a dataset of labeled images
model.fit(X_train, y_train, epochs=10, validation_data=(X_val, y_val))
```
This code defines a CNN model using the MobileNet architecture, which is designed for mobile and embedded devices. The model is trained on a dataset of labeled images and uses a classification head to predict the object classes. The model is then used to make predictions on a live video stream from the API.
